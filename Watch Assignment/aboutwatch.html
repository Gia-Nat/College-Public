      <h5 class="card-title">Our Service</h5>
      <p class="card-text">At one time or another, your watch will need either service or repair in its life. Oftentimes, this will be because your watch is not running well or on time, or it has suffered damage that needs expert repair. 

While the general rule of thumb is getting your watch serviced every two to five years, there are many factors that can contribute to your watch requiring service or repair earlier or more frequently. How often you wear your watch and the conditions in which you are wearing it will affect its everyday functions and wearability ?
